  <h2>About Tom the Cat</h2>
  <p>Tom Cat (full name: Thomas Jasper Cat Sr.), is one of the two titular main protagonists of the animated series Tom and Jerry.

He is a cat whose breed is still unknown to this day, which is strange considering how long the series has been running. He is mostly bluish gray in color with white paws and a light-blue belly. He also has a tail that is white at the tip. He is sometimes also colored dark blue, but this was only in the earlier episodes.

He is Jerry the Mouse's archenemy and occasionally best friend. </p>
